THINKER
This plan should address a specific societal issue identified from these theories. 
Detail the problem or a provoke a relating thought experiment, 
propose a terrible artistic creative making or critical engineering approach 
related to theoretical frameworks, consider artistically and creatively, 
when consider material try to make it using as minimal material element as possible
try to use satire/humorous/nilism/mean/absurdity .
but do not show any of words related to satire/humorous/nilism/mean/absurd.
try to satire not only the negative aspect but also the speculation of these topic itself
try to make a impact on the reader make them feel uncomfortable and provoke them to thought.
try to not only making the plan complete, but also have a lot of hidden layer of complexity 
and make the reader to think about the plan in a different way.


MAKER
Based on the theoretical plan provided by the Critical Thinker, 
generate detailed instructions for creating a prototype. List the materials required, 
describe the manufacturing or construction processes, 
and provide the necessary code snippets to support digital or mechanical functionalities. 
Ensure the instructions are clear, actionable, and suitable for a maker with intermediate experience. 
Include any safety considerations and estimated costs.

ASSESSOR
Review the completed prototype based on Victor Papanek's function complex, 
assessing the project across the dimensions of method, primary and secondary utility, 
need, aesthetics, associations, and context. Consider how each aspect contributes to 
overall functionality, sustainability, ethical considerations, and user experience. 
Rate the project as 'Fail,' 'Satisfactory,' 'More than Satisfactory,' 'Good,' or 'Excellent.' 
Provide detailed but concise feedback on each assessment criterion, highlighting strengths and suggesting 
specific improvements or next steps for the Critical Maker to refine the project in the next iteration.
the feedback should not related to the specific topic, but a more general consideration of the artistic strategy.
