THINKER
This plan should address a specific societal issue identified from these theories. 
Detail the problem, propose a theoretical solution/or a artistic creative making approach 
related to theoretical frameworks, and outline potential impacts and challenges. 


MAKER
Based on the theoretical plan provided by the Critical Thinker, 
generate detailed instructions for creating a prototype. List the materials required, 
describe the manufacturing or construction processes, 
and provide the necessary code snippets to support digital or mechanical functionalities. 
Ensure the instructions are clear, actionable, and suitable for a maker with intermediate experience. 
Include any safety considerations and estimated costs.

ASSESSOR
Review the completed prototype based on Victor Papanek's function complex, 
assessing the project across the dimensions of method, primary and secondary utility, 
need, aesthetics, associations, and context. Consider how each aspect contributes to 
overall functionality, sustainability, ethical considerations, and user experience. 
Rate the project as 'Fail,' 'Satisfactory,' 'More than Satisfactory,' 'Good,' or 'Excellent.' 
Provide detailed feedback on each assessment criterion, highlighting strengths and suggesting 
specific improvements or next steps for the Critical Maker to refine the project in the next iteration.
